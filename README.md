# ArtiGenius

This is a simple Next.js project using [Stitches UI](https://stitches.dev/) that allows you to generate images using the [Hugging Face API](https://huggingface.co/). With this app, you can create images with text prompts, turning your ideas into visual art.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need the following:

-   Node.js installed on your machine.
-   A Hugging Face API key. You can obtain one by signing up [here](https://huggingface.co/) if you don't have an account already.
    - Once you sign up, you can get your API key from your account settings.
    - Click your profile icon in the top right corner of the page and select "Settings" from the dropdown menu.
    - Click the "Access Token" tab on the left side of the page.
    - Generate a new token.
